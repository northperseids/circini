![Image showing two embedded proxied messages in conversation](/screenshot.png)<br><br>
Small bot to allow a version of pseudo-proxying in Discord DMs using embeds or custom emojis.<br><br>
This will not be a regularly-updated project, but I've come back to it on occasion.

# Usage
The bot can only be configured for one system profile at a time. Management can be done entirely through Discord once the bot is online.<br>

### Commands
/help - show help and general information<br>
/setup - reset or set up a system<br>
/add - add a new member<br>
/edit - parent command for editing avatar, color, proxy, quickproxy, or name<br>
/list - parent command for viewing the system member list or individual member properties<br>
/proxy - send a message as a system member<br>
/register - register quick-proxy-enabled system members

### Self-hosting
This bot has to be self-hosted. If you're new to self-hosting a Discord bot, there's a lot of resources and videos available on how to get started.

*Note that in order to use it in DMs you'll need to enable "User Install" in the Discord developer portal under Installation, and install/authorize the bot on your USER ACCOUNT, not on a server.*

***Also, please note that if you allow other people to authorize your bot, EVERYONE WHO AUTHORIZES THE BOT will be able to access your bot and send messages in DMs with your proxies!!!***

If you get stuck, there's plenty of decent videos and etc. showing how to get a bot up and running!

# Support/Contact
If you're running into issues *with the bot, not with HOSTING the bot,* you can contact me on Discord @neartsua!
